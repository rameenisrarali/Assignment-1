<h1><center>SHAHEED MOHTARMAA BENAZIR BHUTTO</center></h1>
     <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
     <p>Benazir Bhutto[a] (21 June 1953 – 27 December 2007) was a Pakistani politician and stateswoman who served as the 11th and 13th prime minister of Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996. She was the first woman elected to head a democratic government in a Muslim-majority country. Ideologically a liberal and a secularist,
         she chaired or co-chaired the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) from the early 1980s until her assassination in 2007.</p>
        <h3>FIRST TERM AS PRIME MINISTER </h3></h> 
        <p>Bhutto's first cabinet was the largest in Pakistan's history.[176] She appointed herself as the new treasury minister, with her mother as a senior minister without portfolio, and her father-in-law as chairman of the parliamentary public accounts committee, quashing hopes that her administration would depart from the entrenched systems of cronyism in the country.[177] Most of those in the administration had little political experience.[178] Various members of the PPP old guard, including Mumtaz Ali Bhutto, left the party in frustration at the pro-capitalist direction she had taken.[177]

            Following her election, there remained significant mistrust between Bhutto and the right-wing military administration; many senior military figures viewed her, like her father, as a threat to their dominant role in Pakistan's political arena.[179] The country's three most powerful figures—the army chief Aslam Beg, the ISI chief Hamid Gul, and President Khan—all had contempt for her family.[180] This opposition was substantial and contributed to Bhutto's inability to pass any major legislation during her first term in office.[181] However, she had some successes with initiatives to encourage the development of civil society;[182] she ensured the release of a number of political prisoners detained under the Zia government.[183] and lifted the ban on trade unions and student associations.[184] She removed many of the constraints imposed on non-governmental organisations,[185] and introduced measures to lift the media censorship introduced by Zia's military administrations.[186] She entrusted Shamsul Hasan with dismantling the National Press Trust, a conglomerate of over 15 newspapers, but President Khan delayed signing the documents and thus the Trust would only be broken up during her second premiership.[187] A number of social reforms were carried out, such as the establishment of new literacy centres, new pension rights, and the abolition of admission and bed fees forced upon during the Zia regime.[188]

            <h4>SECOND TERM AS PRIME MINISTER</h4>
        <p> the October 1993 general election, the PPP won the most seats,[263] although it fell short of an outright majority, with 86 seats.[251]
             Sharif's new party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), came second with 73 seats.[251][264]
              The PPP performed extremely well in Bhutto's native province, Sindh, and rural Punjab, while the PML-N was strongest in industrial Punjab and the largest cities such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.[265] 
              Bhutto was again prime minister, but this time had a weaker parliamentary mandate than she had had in 1988.[266] She was officially sworn in on 19 October 1993.[267]

<h5>FORIEGN POLICY</h5>
<p>Major-General Pervez Musharraf worked closely with Bhutto and her government in formulating an Israel strategy. 
    In 1993 Bhutto ordered Musharraf, then Director-General of the Pakistani Army's Directorate-General for the Military Operation (DGMO), to join her state visit to the United States, unusual and unconventional participation.
     Bhutto and Musharraf chaired a secret meeting with Israeli officials who traveled to the US especially for the meeting. Under Bhutto's guidance Musharraf intensified the ISI's liaison with Israel's Mossad.
      A final meeting took place in 1995, which Musharraf also joined.[333] Bhutto also strengthened relations with its most important partner communist China, and repeatedly visited Beijing for mutual trade and international political co-operation the two countries.[334][335] 
      In 1995, Benazir Bhutto made another state visit to the United States and held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Bhutto urged him to revise the Pressler Amendment and launch a campaign against extremism. 
      She criticised US nonproliferation policy and demanded that the United States honor its contractual obligation.[clarification needed][336]</p>

      <h6><b>PERSONAL LIFE</b> </h6>
      <h7>PERSONALITY</h7>
      <p> <i><q>to Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia, Bhutto possessed a desire to be liked and to be popular, and for this reason "was prepared to be all things to all people", having a "chameleon-like" quality to blend into her environment.[507] 
        Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as "a woman of contradictions".[508] Suvorova similarly observed that Bhutto presented herself differently when in the West compared to when she was in Pakistan.[509]
         While in Pakistan Bhutto presented herself as a conservative Muslim who always wore her head covered, but as a student in Oxford she had adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear a T-shirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine.[503] 
         As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly,
          was never photographed with a glass lest it is interpreted as containing alcohol,
